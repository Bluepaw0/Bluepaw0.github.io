# The message of intertview supplement
I’ve been overthinking a lot lately.
I don’t feel very confident about the pass of interview.
Until yesterday, I was invited to a dinner meeting.
I’m not used to being someone who enjoys exchanging information with others.
However, recently, I’ve noticed myself becoming more open to listening and talking with others.

I should learn from my wife, who regularly goes dancing.
Lately, I’ve been feeling anxious. If I don’t trust myself, who will?
The goals I’ve set for myself seem too small. 
The best approach is to keep moving forward and build good habits.

I often say the right words but fail to put them into practice.
It’s strange how you can understand something and learn it but struggle to act on it.
Talking without action is meaningless.
Methodology alone isn’t very useful. The best way is to take action and find direction through effort.

I hope YSJF will recognize my sincerity, but I also know I may not be the best fit for this job.
This opportunity feels like a door, and I’m standing hesitantly in front of it.
After yesterday’s conversation with two coworkers, I feel more confident.
I realized that many coworkers enjoy working with me, and I’ve received several invitations.
This confirms that quitting my current job was the right decision, and now I’m waiting for YSJF’s interview.
I need to trust myself and consistently invest effort. One day, I will overcome these challenges.

Returning to the title, I wrote a short document for YSJF, the company I want to join.
In this essay, I shared my work and learning experiences from university to the present.
I might fail again and seem strange in others’ eyes, but do I care? No!
Whether I win or lose, both outcomes will push me forward.
Once I start moving, the better views will await me.
