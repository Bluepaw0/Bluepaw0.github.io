# What I learned from playing basketball?
## Both teamwork and individual skills are crucial in basketball
This morning, I watched the Warriors lose their game. It seemed like they didn’t take the match seriously.
In the end, the opponent made the winning shot, the Warroiors lost the game.
Because of this, the Warriors dropped to 7th in the league standings.
This means there’s a high chance they’ll have to compete in the play-in tournament. 
It’s a crucial & danger situation for them.

In the afternoon, after finishing most of my assignments, I went out to play basketball.
I have more skill and power to shoot in. But the result is not good.
My shooting percentage was very low, only about 20%.
In the second half of the game, I didn’t shoot much. 
Instead, I focused on teamwork, like setting screens and passing the ball to create opportunities.
It worked to some extent, but not very well. 
Because of my weak shooting and lack of offensive threat, the opponents’ defense was less intense, which caused trouble for my teammates.

Of course, we lost in the end, but the gap wasn’t too big. 
If I had a higher shooting percentage and improved my offensive threat, I believe we would have won.

## What Kind of Player Do I Need to Become?
When it comes to my game, I have a good sense of teamwork but need to work on my individual skills.
This is the most important area I need to improve.
To win games, I can’t just support my teammates——I also need to contribute more offensively.

Lately, I feel like I’ve made some progress toward my goals.
I’ve regained my physical strength through regular exercise, and I'm gradually improving my English skills.
And I enhance the English using ability.
Although I still struggle to understand many articles and conversations,I’ve noticed I’m getting more comfortable with it.
In the next stage, I hope to keep improving and stay focused on my goals.

Be focused like a laser, catch up with your own second cosmic velocity!
