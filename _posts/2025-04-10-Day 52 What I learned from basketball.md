# What I learned from basketball?
## Teamwork and solo are both important
I saw the game that Warroiors fail in the morning.
The reason seems like didn't attach important to this match.
In the end, the ball was shoot in by oppotent, turn out the winning team.
Because of this, the Warroiors fall down to 7th. Meaning is there's big possible to play-in tournament.
This is really a matter of life and death.

And in the afternoon, I also go out to play a basketball when I finish most of my assignments.
I have more skill and power to shoot in. But the result is not good.
My shooting percentage is very low, just about 20%.
In the second half of the game, I almost don't to shoot, but do many teamwork like set screens and pass the ball to make some oppotunities.
It was work but not very well. Because of my weak shooting and offensive threat, the oppotents defent is small and it became a troble for my teammates.

Of couse we lost in the end, but there isn't mach of gap.
If I have more shooting percentage and enhence my offensive threat. I beleve we must win.

## What kind of man do I need to be?
Back to work, I have more team sense but less personal ability.
It's the biggest thing I think I must to change.
If I want to win the battle, I can't merely sort out the logistics;
I also must assume the responsibilities of a general.

Nowadays, I can fell I get some improve of my target.
I get ability body again by excercises regularly.
And I enhance the English using ability.
Although I still can't understand many articals and dialogues.I found that I got used to it.
I hope in the next stage, I can continuously engage with reality and keep imprtoving myself
Be focused like a laser, catch up with your own second cosmic velocity!
