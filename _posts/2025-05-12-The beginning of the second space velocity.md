# The beginning of the second space velocity
It's hard.

I saw a sentense of that "if you didn't find the way you want to go, I wish you will have courage to begin again.
The biggest thing today is that I submit my resume to DJI. It's a big company in China.
The job is about produce film, I have some experience but I can't speak English fluently yet now.

But it's not totally bad for me.
This job vacancy is prove that my judgement is right.
English is important in our carreer and in this area.
My leaning speed is not fast but I can feel the advencement.
And now I have more vocabulary to use, the speed must go fater than before.

And I also realize that HR who watched my resume was silence.
Maybe my resume is bad which can't compete with each others.
Or those people don't like my hometown, where I come from is a faraway province and it hasn't good education.
The biggest reason is in myself. If I can do what I want to do, I will be success.
But success is not easy, make things done are not easy too.
I have't hate anybody even my dad who call me again tonight. 

Then the reason I create this Blog is for lighting.
Let's think what can we do tomorrow?
Today I finished 60% assignments, I still not focus on the most important thing.
Tomorrow I will adjust a little my todo list and try to finish 80%.

I know more about what I really want to be.
I want to development forever, not only output(for money) but also input(for growth).
I wish that if I have a team or company, which will can do it.
Keeping the balence is the key thing of the next stage for me.
