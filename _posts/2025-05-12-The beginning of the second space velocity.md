# The beginning of the second space velocity
It's hard.

I came across a sentence that said: "If you haven't found the way you want to go, I wish you have the courage to begin again."
The most significant thing I did today was submitting my resume to DJI, a major company in China. 
The job involves film production, and while I have some experience, I can’t speak English fluently yet.

But it's not totally bad for me.
This job opportunity is proof that my judgment was right.
English is crucial for our careers, especially in this field.
My learning speed isn’t fast, but I can feel the advancement.
Now that I have a larger vocabulary, I should learn faster than before.

I also realized that the HR representative who reviewed my resume was silent.
Maybe my resume isn’t competitive enough, or perhaps they have biases against my hometown, a remote province with limited educational resources.
But the main issue lies within me. If I can achieve what I set out to do, I will be successful.
Success isn’t easy, and getting things done is just as hard.
I don’t hate anyone, not even my dad, who called me again tonight.

I created this blog for self-reflection.
Let’s think about what we can do tomorrow.
Today, I completed 60% of my assignments, but I still didn’t focus on the most important tasks.
Tomorrow, I’ll make some adjustments to my to-do list and aim to finish 80%.

I’m gaining clarity about what I truly want to be.
I want continuous development—not just focusing on output for financial gain but also on input for personal growth.
I hope that if I ever have my own team or company, it will embody this balance.
Maintaining that balance will be crucial for the next phase of my journey.
