# Why I cross 1000+KM to attend a wedding?

**Background:**
This is a wedding of my highschool classmate, who is good person helped me to preper classmate reunion last year.
He is working at Shanghai as a programer, he always so humble but I know he is a smart person.
The best thing I learned from him is empressement.
If you talked once with him or talked online, he will be ture and have a kind of sincere "buddha-like" attitude.
I admire this kind of man, who is positive and without charade

**Why am I do this?**
Although I am foolish man, I can bet there are not many people will attend a wedding across so far.
Many things I can take a question to myself "why should be you? I know you admire this person but why you are always a few individuals?"
I think it's a choise of mine. Think different. Maybe it has a little crazy but that's be true for me.
There's a thing if you can't do that you will lose your heart. 
Cycling to Lasha, quit a job for a chance to make a greater product, connect with friends and colleagues for better future of world.
It's realy exciting to do themselves.

**The growth I got these days.**
I found a key thing is that although wish, idea or direction is important, the actual execution process is the most challenging and difficult.
learning: The study schedule is not to catch the goal (I want to talk fluently end this period) It's harder than my think.
Now I have changed a way to execute, put those harder tasks in morning do them first. It seems go better.
train: I always give myself a lot of tasks in one trip, so I will decrease assignment this time.
Less is more I know it gradully.
working: My work target is do things better rather than stand on a higher place to enjoy those power.
I hate manegement but like synergia. Excution is important too.
Who just has a idea but can't make things happen, it just please yourself.
And I begin to know "Don't afraid your competitor untile they push the real product out".
I also understand more about "Keeping moving forword happily there is no end of the road".
