# The first week of YSJF
I like the envirment of this company and furtunately I join a new item crew.
The stormcrew, I know how to spell it now.
Although the direction is to overcome the Mr.beast, I didn't watch a lot of video of them.
I fell intersted and excited, because I can have more power or resource to achieve those wonderful things.

Tim is a good man, he have the ability to decide where should we go.
When we can't confuse ourselves, he always give us feedbacks and confidences.
There are some not very good things were happened too.
But now I don't care it anymore, these things can't affect me anymore.

And I asked my classmate who studied in the UK.
He told me that English or anything there is no shortcut, but it doesn't very hard.
His opinion give me a lot of confidence, this is the way I'd like to go.

In the end, join this company is my biggest oppotunity!
Cherish time keep going, let's catch the oppotunity!
To do some wonderful things.
