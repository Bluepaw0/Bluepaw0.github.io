# Lost moment
I'm so good, think a lot about other person but most related person.
It's as same as my father, who always care more about those outside people but my childhood.
I told myself don't be those kind of man, take care of your family more.
But now, I am those kind of man.

I give myself 180 days to learn English.
My target is speak English fluently, but now I'm just use the basic words to speak and write, and my reading skill just in mid leavel.

My wife shoot me some photos, I can't see that activity in before.
Recall that I have more ambitions in career.
I seems know the direction that I want to go.
But I'm totally lose this game.

Time change people change places change.
But I don't want back to it.
I hope that I can build the future of myself.

If something I think it's right but I can't executeï¼Œwell it is the thing you good at it right ?
Make it happen, and go forward.
Change it from every step rather than just think in your mind.

Finish your first item as possible as you can.
Keeping moving, the target will find you.
