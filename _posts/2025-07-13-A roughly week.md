# A roughly week
I work 18 days constently.
I learned a lot of things and make many friends.
This week I found the English skill is so important in this company.
I must learn it quickly, and I contact my classmate and asked a course department.
Xingdongfang, the famous school when I was young.
I also want to pay for talking to foreign teather online.

Internet is the most wonderful thing of my period.
After two weeks, I found I'm not so shy and I can make more friends in this company.
I also want to connect easily with other countries' people.
If I can do that I will have another super power in this real world.

Nowadays, my direction is very clear.
But I know the distance of dream and exercise after half year.
Ready to run the marathon of you, plan it accest it and try your best to make it happen.
I'd like to see the different man after this journey.
