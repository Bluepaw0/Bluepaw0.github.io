# A Day of Job Hunting
Today is the day I officially start my job hunt.
My previous scattered attempts at searching and applying for jobs have shown me how difficult it is.
It's challenging, and the market for Bilibili has declined significantly.
People don't like this platform as much as they used to.
As my uncle says, customer tastes change very quickly.

I found a company that excited me.
But when I got there by metro, even though my ankle injury hasn’t healed yet, I discovered that the company had closed.
I’m not sure if it went bankrupt or something else happened, but it didn’t seem like a happy situation.

How can I stay positive on this path?
Should I focus on what I’m talented at or the value I can offer?
In the evening, I found a promising opportunity on the Boss app. 
It’s a company that developed a smart whiteboard and is located nearby.
If I can join this company, I can provide what they need, and it aligns with my three areas of interest: English, Product, and teamwork.
I’ve decided to focus more on this opportunity tomorrow.

I need to grow and learn from this experience.
Growing means I can see the progress in myself, like moving from a beginner to an intermediate level in English.
Even though I still make many mistakes, I have more confidence to write in English.
It’s a good thing for me; I believe I can achieve what I want.
I believe that in the future, I will thank myself for taking this opportunity.
