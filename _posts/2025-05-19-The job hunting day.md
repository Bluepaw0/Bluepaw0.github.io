# The job hunting day
Today is the formal day that I'm hunting the job.
As the experience of those scattered search and submit tells me that is hard.
It's difficult and the maket of Bilibili goes down very huge.
People don't like this platform than before.
As the saying of my ancle goes: The taste of customer is changing very fast.

I found a company which makes me exciting.
But when I did get there by metro, even I haven't cure from the injure of ankle.
Unforturnately, this company has closed. I don't know is it brokedown or otherthings, but I guess it wasn't very happy.

How going happy in this road?
To do waht I talented? or the value I can offer?
In the evening I found a light from Boss app. That is a company which built a smart white board nearby.
If I can join this company, I can offer what they want and it will match my all 3 direction, English, Product and team.
I decide I will pull more attantion in it tomorrow.

I must grow up again after this stage.
Grow up is generally I can feel the difference of myself, from a beginer to an intermidia English learner.
Even I still have many mistakes but I have more "bullute" to write in English.
It's a good thing for me, I believe I can get what I want to get.
I believe that I will say thanks to myself for the oppotunity.
