# The result is coming
I learned a lot in this period. It costs above a half year to make me realize it.
I don't know how to catch the most important need when I take this interview.
As many times I didn't do the right thing.
When I was in learning age I was gaming and joyful guy.
When I shouldn't trust people, I trust them and lose about Â¥60,000.
And this time nobody knows me is a person who want to achieve something with team.
Thought am I show my hamble too much without trust which come from those behieves of before.
I'm stupid man who open my mind at first.
Will the honest man eat shit in the beginning, peocessing and ending?

Today is the day after I finished the interview 10 days later.
There is no feedback from the department boss.
What can I do? I sent two documents to HR and she help me to transform to department boss.
And I put myself down as much as I can do.
I said that "If I can't do well you can fire me quickly in early era".
Maybe I will get the worst information from the phone ring.
Maybe sometimes the message will tell me I finally fail.
Maybe I can't recieve any message from Yijun anymore.

But I still have some rewards, maybe fail is not the worst thing.
The worst thing is I have't the courague for this direction.
The result pick me up that I still can follow the direction from deep-thinking.
I believe that thinking is a important job for company.
To make some strateges and make them working, you can get 2 times reward.

But as a realisted and a idealisted man, should I feed my self and home first?
And try me best to do some wanderful things.
It's seems like good and useful.
But I trust more about if you want do a thing, you should do it well.
It's named focus and it's from Steve Jobs and Elon Musk I think.
"Why you waste time to do those shit job?"
Am I just talking for happy? 
Is it I can't afford those operation fees, that I become a joker. 
Post some idealistic things in friend's circle.

It's a remarkeble memory which happened in my 27.
I will be 28 years old two monthes later.
I still have a little dream that I want to make a company to do some valueble things.
YOLO, you only live one time.
When I think about that I always remind myself people will go die, I was proud about what I'm doing rather then what I'm using.
Use conststant envolve technolege and besiness mode to make wonderful and cheerful contant products.
I believe it and I want to achieve it.
