# The result is coming
I’ve learned a lot during this period.
It took me over half a year to realize certain things. 
I still don’t know how to identify the most important needs when preparing for an interview. 
Too many times, I’ve failed to do the right thing.

When I was younger, during my learning years, I was a carefree, gaming enthusiast.
When I shouldn’t have trusted people, I did, and I lost about ¥60,000.
Now, it feels like no one sees me as someone who wants to achieve something meaningful with a team.
Perhaps I’ve shown too much humility without building trust, a result of my past experiences.
I’ve been naive, opening my heart too quickly.
Does an honest person always face hardship at the start, in the process, and at the end?

Today is ten days after my interview, and I still haven’t received feedback from the department boss. 
I sent two documents to HR, and she forwarded them to the boss.
I downplayed myself as much as I could during the interview, even saying, “If I don’t perform well, you can fire me early on.”
I’m bracing for bad news—a phone call or message telling me I’ve failed. 
Maybe I won’t hear from Yijun at all.

Still, there are some silver linings. Failure isn’t the worst outcome. 
The worst would be lacking the courage to pursue my direction. 
This experience has shown me I can still follow my path through deep thinking. 
I believe strategic thinking is critical for any company. 
By crafting and executing effective strategies, you can achieve twice the reward.

As both a realist and an idealist, should I prioritize providing for myself and my family first? 
Should I strive to do remarkable things? 
It seems like a practical and meaningful balance. 
But I firmly believe that if you want to do something, you should do it well.
This idea of focus comes from people like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. 
“Why waste time on meaningless work?” 
Am I just talking big to feel good? 
Am I joking because I can’t afford the costs of pursuing my dreams?
I post idealistic thoughts in my friend circle, but are they just words?

This is a remarkable memory from my 27th year. 
In three months, I’ll turn 28.
I still hold a small dream of starting a company to create something valuable. 
YOLO—you only live once. 
When I think about mortality, I remind myself to take pride in what I’m making, not just what I’m using. 
"Continuously create touching content products through iterative technologies and business models."
I believe in this vision, and I’m determined to achieve it.
