# The outdoor day
When I feel pressure, I always go out to see new places. This time, I followed my idea to take a bus and observe the scenery along the way. 
The road wasn’t as I had imagined, but my dream of traveling by bus came true. It made me reflect on the difference between dreams and reality. 
I told the people at YSJF that I have ideas and dreams, but I can also see the truth. I will strive to balance them and follow a clear strategy.

I reviewed my recent face-to-face interview, and the biggest problem was that I didn’t understand the company’s or team’s needs. 
This led to me positioning myself incorrectly.
I focused too much on talking manage skill, hiding my daily job and didn’t prepare the details they wanted. 
On the other hand, I understood the direction of their questions. 
So why didn’t I answer well? The most important reason is that I lacked confidence.
Additionally, I viewed the company and its founder through a filter of assumptions.

I hope I can get a change to try it.
If I don’t perform well, I’ll move on quickly.
The result, whether good or bad, is the best gift I can give to them and myself.

While traveling through the city and a small mountain park, I listened to a podcast featuring the vice president of Zhuimi, a cleaning robot brand.
I learned a lot, and I realized the best way to communicate is by giving relevant examples in the field.
Don’t make excuses—the most important thing is to be honest. 
I made a mistake by mentioning something I hadn’t completed, which is the wrong way to compete with others.
I don’t need to be a 100% perfect fit for the job, but I can improve quickly, and I’m eager to become a suitable candidate.

Give me just one month and one or two tasks, and I’m confident I can excel in this job.
I watched all the videos on their channel and understand how to cooperate with others.
I hope I can concentrate my energy, and I hope you can help me to complete the half year iteration.

I have the ability to collaborate with a team using care and patience.
I can find the right direction and resources to solve problems. 
I’m passionate about this industry, and I hope I can contribute to the company and brand’s growth.
