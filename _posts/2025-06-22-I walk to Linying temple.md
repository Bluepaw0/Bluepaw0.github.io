# I walk to Linying temple
Today, I got up early and went to the famous Linying Temple in Hangzhou.
My wife and I traveled there by electric motorbike.
As we were almost there, we followed the path most people were taking.
However, we decided to turn in another direction and went to the mountain before the temple.

We were curious at the beginning, but as time passed, we became hot and sweaty in the approximately 36-degree Celsius heat.
The road was very challenging, almost like a cliff, and many people were climbing the mountain with difficult and bitter expressions.
I climbed more slowly than before; one reason was that I had a cold, and the other was that I realized I didn’t need to compete with anyone.

We passed three temples and visited all of them.
In each, we picked up three incense sticks, made some wishes, and then placed them in the burning area.
Finally, we arrived at Linying Temple, but Ya didn’t come with me because of the ticket cost (we wanted to save money).

When I walked into the temple, I was amazed again.
I saw many more scenes than before; I had been there twice, but this time I truly engaged with my heart.
I enjoyed and prayed at every effigy,noticing many details I had never considered before.
Just like in life, I had an opportunity to see myself without any distractions.
It was the best experience for me—to look at myself just by myself.

Wherever I grew up, wherever I traveled, whatever I did before, at that moment, I had a pure heart.
Now, as I try to savor it, it’s reminiscent of my journey cycling in Tibet.
Oh, it’s so different; it’s so calm.
There are no competitors, no stress; there is just nature and yourself.

I don’t see those things as my rewards; I see them as part of my life.
Every memory I have, every opportunity I might have—they are also part of my life.
Tomorrow could very well be the end day.
I have become more mature,and I hope it will happen.
