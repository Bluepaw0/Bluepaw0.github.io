# I walk to Linying temple
Today I got up early, and went to a famous temple of Hangzhou Linying temple.
I and my wife went there by e-motor, when we almost get there, we followed the way of most people travelling.
So we turned to another direction and went to mountain before the temple.

We were curious at beginning but as time goes by, we got hot and wet in about 36 cecious degrees.
And the road is so hard like a cliff, a lot of people climb this mountain but always be hard and bitter face.
I climbde slowly than before, the one reason is I was get a cold, other is I realised I neednâ€™t compete anything with people.

We passed three temples and we went in all of them.
We pick up three xiang and prey some wishes then put them to the burn place.
Finally we arrieved at the Linying temple, but Ya didn't follow with me because of tickets cost(We want to save money).

When I walked in the temple, I was amazied again.
I saw a lot of scenes than before, I got there twice but this time I take my heart.
I enjoy and prey in every efigy, I found many detail those I never consided.
As same as life, I had an oppotunity to saw myself without anything.
It's the best job for me, look myself just by myself.

Where ever I growed up before, where ever I traveled before, what ever I did before.
I had a pure heart at that moment.
Now I try to taste it, it's like my jouney of cycling in tiblet.
Oh, it's so diferrent it's so calm.
There's no competiters there's no strees there is nature with yourself.

I don't see those things as my rewords, I see them as a part of my life.
Every memories I have, every oppotunites I might have, there are also is a part of my life.
Tomorrow has high possible to be the END day.
I got more mature, I wish it will happen.
