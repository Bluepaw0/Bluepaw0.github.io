# Wait it doesn't end
I got messages from HR again.She said she just forgot resent me.
It's like a sunlight in the dark.
And I decide go to a temple to make a wish tomorrow.

I don't know things will go witch way, but it doesn't end right?
These days I read a lot pages of Elon Musk with sound.
I found this is a good way to read quickly. 
It's good for first time to read a English book.

Now although I only can use basic words, I can express myself more.
Like a dream slip in my mind that I want to go to the eage of sea and west lake with my grandmother.
And I figure it out that English learning is not only an exercise but also a learning itself true.
I need put more attantion in this area for good reward.
And it's a right fly wheel, when I learned more English I can get more information from reading or talking.
Maybe I can open a bigger world from this ability.

I'm going to 30s, I saw more significant things.
Career, finance and family ect.
I don't know is this step right or not.
At least I had an opportunity, and I still trying to get better.
So it doesn't end, don't give up.
Be optimistic, tomorrow is a lucky day.
