# Wait, It Doesn't End
I got messages from HR again.
She said she had forgotten to resend the documents to me.
It felt like a ray of sunlight in the dark.
And I decided to go to a temple to make a wish tomorrow.

I don’t know which way things will go, but it’s not the end, right?
These days, I have been reading a lot about Elon Musk with an audiobook.
I found this to be a good way to read quickly.
It’s good for the first time reading an English book.

Although I can only use basic words now, I can express myself better.
A dream slips into my mind: I want to go to the edge of the sea and West Lake with my grandmother.
I realized that learning English is not just an exercise but a true learning experience.
I need to put more attention in this area for a good reward.
It’s like a flywheel; the more English I learn, the more information I can gain from reading or talking.
Perhaps this ability will open up a bigger world for me.

As I approach my 30s, I have seen more significant things: career, finance, family, etc.
I don’t know if this step is right or not.
At least I have an opportunity, and I am still trying to get better.
So, it doesn’t end here. Don’t give up. 
Be optimistic; tomorrow is a lucky day.
