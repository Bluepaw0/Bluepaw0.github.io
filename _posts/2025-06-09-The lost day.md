# The Lost Days
It has been a week since I accepted the job interview.
I am enduring a journey like a roller coaster.
Now it’s 11:30 PM. A neighbor is frying meals with the door open.

I like talking about dreams but can’t provide a normal life for my wife.
I always complain about my dad and family who owe so much money.
But I don’t put my whole energy into executing my decisions.
I live in a world that I have closed off myself.
Those relatives and those problems are all excuses.
Why have I become a person like this?
Isn’t the fact of the job or the choice my own willing or fantasy?
Am I really unable to make it?

I’m anxious now; I almost shouted aloud.
Why is the world like this?
Why haven’t I gotten the next interview?
Why is my English still so poor?
Why is my body deteriorating again?
Why am I losing my life?

The fact is, Win or lose, I still be myself.
I have also gained some experiences from this failure.
Just being myself, I found that this is the most important thing I can keep.
I believe in my decision; 
I can accept the bad results but don’t want to share the bitterness with my family.
Team->Be a producter of video this year.
English->Speak fluently this year.
Product->Make a good contant product this year.

Be stronger and be confident.
Now that I know my dream clearly, face the pain and move bravely!
The second cosmic velocity is boosted by myself.
