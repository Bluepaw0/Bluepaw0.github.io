# Put my heart somewhere
If you travel to some places, you will have the taste of a memory that was put in that place. 
I have some pieces of memory stored in several places.
One is in my hometown. There are a lot of happy, bitter, or spicy memories in that little town
I remember I liked climbing the mountains near the town too.
There is a small pool in the middle of the mountain, and many tadpoles lived in that place.

When I grew up a little, I put some memories in a city with my high school.
The smell becomes bricks of buildings.
It is not a wonderful smell, but there are a lot of things I can taste sweet.

I found some pictures of the journey I bicycled to Tibet.
Although a lot of years have passed, the smell is so fresh.
Wild, wonderful, strategic, courage, and ideal.
Hard, but it is my most wonderful memory.

I also put my heart in the future, although it always gives me a punch.
I still have time and a chance to make it happen, right?
Sorry that I wrote this essay so private and messy.
I wish I can trust myself. I’m good, and I can become better too.
I can organize my life and go on to the next planet that is waiting for me.


# Places That Hold My Heart
Rewrite by Grok 3.

Certain places in our lives become keepers of our memories, holding the tastes, smells, and feelings of moments we’ve lived. For me, these places—my hometown, a high school city, a journey to Tibet, and even the future—carry pieces of my heart.

My hometown is a small town cradled by mountains, a place filled with a mix of happy, bitter, and spicy memories. I used to climb the mountains nearby, my sneakers crunching against the rocky paths. One day, I found a small pool tucked into the mountainside, alive with tadpoles darting through the water. That little discovery still feels like a snapshot of pure, simple joy from my childhood.

Later, when I grew a bit older, I left memories in the city where I went to high school. The air there carried the sharp scent of concrete and exhaust, a stark contrast to my hometown’s fresh breezes. It wasn’t always a pleasant smell, but it was sweetened by the laughter of friends, the thrill of new experiences, and the dreams I began to chase amid the stacks of buildings.

One memory stands out brighter than the rest: the time I bicycled to Tibet. I recently found pictures from that journey, and even though years have passed, the wild beauty of it feels as fresh as ever. The wind whipped through my hair, carrying the scent of dust and freedom. It was hard—grueling at times—but it taught me courage and fueled my ideals. That journey remains my most wonderful memory, a testament to what I’m capable of.

I also place my heart in the future, though it often feels intimidating, like a punch to the chest. But I have time and a chance to shape it, don’t I? I believe I can organize my life, step boldly into what’s next, and explore the unknown like it’s a new planet waiting for me.

These places—past, present, and yet to come—are more than just locations. They hold my memories, my growth, and my hopes. Together, they tell the story of where I’ve been and where I’m going.
