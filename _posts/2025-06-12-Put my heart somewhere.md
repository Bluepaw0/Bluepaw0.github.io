# Put my heart somewhere
If you travel to some places, you will have the taste of a memory that was put in that place. 
I have some pieces of memory stored in several places.
One is in my hometown. There are a lot of happy, bitter, or spicy memories in that little town
I remember I liked climbing the mountains near the town too.
There is a small pool in the middle of the mountain, and many tadpoles lived in that place.

When I grew up a little, I put some memories in a city with my high school.
The smell becomes bricks of buildings.
It is not a wonderful smell, but there are a lot of things I can taste sweet.

I found some pictures of the journey I bicycled to Tibet.
Although a lot of years have passed, the smell is so fresh.
Wild, wonderful, strategic, courage, and ideal.
Hard, but it is my most wonderful memory.

I also put my heart in the future, although it always gives me a punch.
I still have time and a chance to make it happen, right?
Sorry that I wrote this essay so private and messy.
I wish I can trust myself. Iâ€™m good, and I can become better too.
I can organize my life and go on to the next planet that is waiting for me.
