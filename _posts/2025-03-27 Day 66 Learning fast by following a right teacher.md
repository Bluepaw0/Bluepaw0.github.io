# Learning fast by fllowing a right teacher
**I Changed my learning method today**. 

Using compresible input and regular grammar rules togather.
I found if you have a guided way or a person to help you, you will grow faster.

**Good methods are important too.** 

In the afternoon, I clicked a grammar cource which in bilibili.

Acluding the running posture I learned from online, thanks for intnet and AI age. I'm able to do effictively and conficiently.
