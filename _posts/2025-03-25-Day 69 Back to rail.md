# Back to rail
## Tilrd but walk indeed
Now I'm lisoning 90's songs in my list, feeling back to childhood.
Summer is coming soon again, momeries are crash down in this period.
Sometimes I am able to see back is stronge and magic thing.
It is real, saying a man is like a alchol in ages.
I was came this city for 3 years. My girlfriend, wife now, has been here two and half year.
There are excuted when we recall the memory in those early days.

## Fly a kite
I flied a kite last weenkend and found 2 things I need remember.
1_Only do 1 thing everytime
I was want using time efficently, so I put 3 things in that trip.
Photograph with ya, walk with hot pot and fly a kite.
Perfect plan, rubbish action. I can't do any small thing well.

2_Wait wind
Fly a kite also needs stratige. I decided to fly it after sunset, because I predict that will windy.
But at the begining there's no wind, I try hard to run to fly a kite.
It does make sense whatever I run fast.
Then as quick as I will give up, wind come.
I just stand in original place, but the kite fly farer and farer.

Hope I can use in something.
bty, my running skill and ability are enhencing. I'm saving steps as same as saving money.
Growing is the most wonderful thing~
