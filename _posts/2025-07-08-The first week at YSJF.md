# The first week at YSJF
I like the environment at this company, and fortunately, I’ve joined a new project team called Stormcrew.
I’ve learned how to spell it correctly now.
Although the goal is to surpass MrBeast, I haven’t watched many of their videos.
I feel interested and excited because I have more resources and opportunities to achieve amazing things.

Tim is a great leader with the ability to guide us clearly.
When we feel confused, he always provides feedback and boosts our confidence.
Some minor issues came up, but I don’t let them bother me anymore—they no longer affect me.

I also spoke with a classmate who studied in the UK.
He told me that learning English or mastering any skill has no shortcuts, but it’s not too difficult either.
His advice gave me a lot of confidence, and it reinforced that this is the path I want to follow.

In the end, joining this company is my biggest opportunity!
I’ll cherish my time here, keep pushing forward, and seize this chance to do something extraordinary.
