# Foot, career and risk
As I said in blog before, I twiked my angle in a baskitable last week.
Now, it's still edema. I have to pick up my walking stick again.
It make me sad and recognize that if you in poor station you will get more risk.
Once you get injure you won't work, and hard to live even it needn't go to the hospital.

Risk is huge important in poor or ordinary person's life.
These works I was read from book, but I didn't feeling with it until this time.
I'm so graceful for this period I suffer.
I learned a lot, I can walk on the ground again. And I still insist my direction, move forward a little per day.

I have the ability to re-distribute my energy.
And I 'm doing my first contant product.
Maybe I'll always be a small man in whole life, but I'll try to make my idea done, just make it happen.

The road of the cycling tell me that if you want go forward, every step will be hard.
I like the feeling what I'm still trying, if I'm not, I will go die.
Find the way you want to go, and solving sth. create sth.

Life will going well, you still have dream.
Make it happen.
