# Foot, Career, and Risk

As I mentioned in my blog before, I twisted my ankle in a basketball game last week. 
Now, it’s still swollen. I have to use my walking stick again. 
It makes me sad and realize that if you’re in a poor situation, you face more risks. 
Once you get injured, you can’t work, and it’s hard to live even if you don’t need to go to the hospital.

Risk is hugely important in a poor or ordinary person’s life. 
These ideas I read in a book, but I didn’t connect with them until now. 
I’m so grateful for this period I’ve suffered.
I learned a lot, and I can walk on the ground again. 
And I still stick to my direction, moving forward a little each day.

I have the ability to redistribute my energy. 
And I’m working on my first content product. 
Maybe I’ll always be an insignificant person in my whole life, but I’ll try to realize my ideas, just make them happen.

Cycling on the road tells me that if you want to go forward, every pedal is hard. 
I like the feeling that I’m still trying; if I’m not, I will die. 
Find the way you want to go, solve something, create something.

Life will go well as long as you still have a dream. 
Make it happen.
