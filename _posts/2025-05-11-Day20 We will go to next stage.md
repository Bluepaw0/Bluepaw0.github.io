# We will go to next stage
Unfortunately, I was hurt in basketball game.
I sprained my ankle and got a pounch on my right face.
So I can only walk with my hiking pole.
And my right eye can't see clearly when I experience impacts.
Now, looking back, it was dangerous because of these two accidents.

After I got hurt, I went out of the playground and waited for my coworkers to finish the game.
It was so embarrssing and regretful that I could only play with them for one round.
Maybe I'm not a luckey man, or my luck was used up saving my life.

I am still bathered by my father, who wants to borrow money from me again.
And I'm haven't retrieved the money I lent to my high school classmate.
It's not a small amount of money. I'm so naive to face society.

Then I didn't answer the phone from my dad.
This is the first time I've refused to connect with him.
I do remember who give me the encouragement and consistency.
Not my dad, but some from my mom, and others from my relatives.
I want to return to my mom and my relatives first.
Maybe my childhood is like Elon's.
I can feel those uncomfortable things from family and society.

The third negetive thing was from Ya, who sold the gold for our wedding.
I can feel the tense atmosphere when the clerk saw what we want to sell.
There are rings,earring and necklace that is to say three gold items for wedding.
If Ya's mom knew, she would kill me.
And Ya wanted to earn money but, but in the end, we lost Â¥1,500 after we caculated.
Hmm, we always have lessons from society.

It's quick to get back to the career.
I'm not sure if I am in the second space velocity, because I'm not only taking the English goal but also not attending the dream company.
I learned a lot from this time, like the start-up of my first year when I graduated.

Now Ya is almost 30 years old, and I will be 28 years old soon.
I failed again; I put not only myself but also my wife in dangerous area.
I always reflect and think a lot after sunset, but I can't insist on what I really wanted or what I should focus on.
Thinking is easy, doing is hard, and insisting on the direction and keeping forward step by step is most difficult.
If I really want to start up should I do those things nobody wants to do.

Today, I also realised Ya's emotion.
A little negetive and some unknow, she also want to live like other people who have a happy family.
Is it my failure but shared with another person who I love?
I don't know why the result is just like what my dad did?

Time will never come back.
I still have some advantages and I feel that I'm becoming more mature.
I can handle the pressure and know more about myself after this period.
I will give a good family to those people who loved me. Because I love them very much too.
