# We will go to next stage
Unfortunately I was hurt in basketball game.
I sprained my ankle and got a pounch on my right face.
So I just can walk with my hiking pole.
And my right eye can't see clear when I bearing impacts.
Now, look back it was dangerous of these two accidents.

After I got hurt I go out of the playground and waiting for my coworkers finish game.
It was so ambarase and regreted I just play with them for one ground.
May be I'm not luckey man or my luckey was finished for save my life.

I still bathered by my father, who want to lend money again for me.
And I'm not bring back my borrow from my highschool classmate.
It's not a small money. I'm so navie to face the society.

Then I not catch the phone from my dad.
This is my first time I'm refuse to connect with him.
I did remember who give me the encourage and consiste.
Not my dad but some from my mom, and others from my relatives.
I want to return to my mom and my relatives first.
Maybe my childhood is like Elons.
I can feel those uncomfortable things from family and society.

The third negetive thing was from Ya, who selled the gold for wedding with me.
I can feel the tense atmosphere when the clerk see what we want to sell.
There are rings and necklace for wedding.
If Ya's mom know she will kill me.
And Ya want to earn money but in the end we lost Â¥1500 after we caculate.
Emmm, we alway have course from society.

It's quick to back to the career.
I'm not sure that I am in the second space velocity, because I'm not only take the English goal but also not attend the dream company.
I learned a lot from this time, like the start up of my first year when I graduated.

Now Ya almost 30 years old, and I will be 28 years old soon.
I failed again, I put not only myself but also my wife in dangerous area.
I always feedback and think a lot after sunset, but I can't insist what I really wanted or I should focused.
Think is easy do is hard, and insist the direction and keep forward step by step is most difficult.
If I really want to start up should I do those things who doesn't want to do.

Today, I also realised Ya's emotion.
A little negetive and some unknow, she also want to live like other people who have a happy family.
Is it my failure but share with another person who I love.
I don't know why the result just like my dad did. 
If I move a small step once.

Time will never back.
I still have some advantiges and I feeled that I'm going more mature.
I can handle the pressure and know more about myself after this period.
I will give a good family for those people who loved me. Because I love them very much too.
