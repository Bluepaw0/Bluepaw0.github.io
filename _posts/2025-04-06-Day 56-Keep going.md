# Keep going (1st weekly report)

1_Weekly feedback
2_Daily feedback
3_Second week plan

## Introduce of background
Without lucky, do not selected by half marathon team.
Cycling to ysjf again, I seems myself like too ordinary and too normal.
The mind is not happy, there are some angrer and noise in it.
I found that I will drop in a deeper place every 7 or 10 days.
It's next day I get up and write this. My mind is not bad as yesterday.
Let's do a feedback~

**1_Weekly feedback**
There were not big progresses, I keep my self better in up half peried more.
After Therthday I jumped my world suddenly, because Ya was going to travel in this small holiday.
So if let's talk about a reason, I think it's not organized not focus.

**2_Daily feedback**
As last paragraph said, I did bad in back half of week.
How should I do? I think do things with science(plan) and encourage are the key.
It's a big target like cycling to Tibet. So divide the target to many small plans and do them insistly is very important.
I need set some wonderful feedbacks too, to encourage myself without too many negetive power.

**3_Second week plan**
I have two palns now, a study plan and an excercise plan.
They are both of made by Grok as well as AI.
I want follow them a period of time to know how I work and live in this AI time.
They are going not bad right now, only small steps in study plan need to adjust.
Next is encourage myself, I thought an idea is that I can give myself a chance to travel in Hangzhou city.
I come here about 3.5 years but not visit it very well.
If I can do these plans well, I can go outside once a week.
And I also give my self some small front feedback in normal things, I think it's video time.
If I do well those assignments in half day, I will get a chance to watch a meanningful video. 
That means it will take over 1 hour of me, but I think it's worth and intersting.
