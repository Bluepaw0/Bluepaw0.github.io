# What I really want to do?
Yesterday, I found a job that is from Yunnanbaiyao which is a pharmaceutical company.
Firstly, I was not thinking about it, but I was wondring at evening.
If I can join a big company with good product, can I play a valuable role?
If I come back to Yunnan, should we have a happier life.
Because the salary can afford the normal life in Kunming.
It's also the martiple person choosed in my hometown.

After this period, I gain an experience that expend the circle of influence and ability.
May I have another way to go, it's higher and more difficult way with unstable but I'm sure that I will gain more from pain.
But if I choose the second one, Ya and her dream that have a small family is waiting longer.
I'm confused of that now, but the HR of this job didn't reply me yet.
I really don't like the feeling of passive.

The most important thing in my mind is could I offer some value?
Not only for work, but also for costomer, for those person who use our product.
The number of return is hinge on the number of value.

And I almost think clearly a thing is what's the selfmedia is?
I think the most important function is connect.
If I could make the value from connect?
The  knowledge of connection, the emotion of connection and the brand value of connection.

Learn from the failures, learn from those great person.
Like Elon says "Keeping reading". I realize I can grow up with those wonderful book.
Now I realised what kind of road I want to go.
I wish I can see where's the value from, and put myself in it.
I also wish that I can solve it.
Plan -> do -> learn -> make it happen -> plan again.
Learning from every item and every person in every day.
I believe that I will make some wonderful things happen.
