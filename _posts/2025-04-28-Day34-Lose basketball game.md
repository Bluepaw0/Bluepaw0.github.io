# Lose basketball game 
I think I already have pawer to play well in fild basketball game.
But I lose big! Not only attact but also defence, and get an injery again.
Nobody likes lose, I want to win a game before May's lable day.

I am wonding that why I can't play well?
In another opinion, I still can't speak English fluently.
And the worst thing is I have a little afraid of learning.
It seems like if I don't go on, I won't lose anytime. Fuck this mind!

Futunately, I got the half marathon goal before days.
I finished 21.09KM in 2 hours by running.
I realise a thing is that if you can insist to do a small things day by day, you will finish a imporsible/big thing for you.

So I decide insist thses 3 things.
1_Get up early and go out for exercise for 1 hour per day.
2_Learning English for 1 hour per day.
3_Keep writing the blog every. Make a summerise of this day.

If I can insist them I trust I will win back! Play wonderful live wonderful.
