# Watched a movie by Akira Kurosawa -- the Rashomon
The first time I watched Akira's movie is Ikiru.
Can't believe that a movie can shoot so wonderful.
A story was talked very well. And the talking skill is wonderful too.
It's not odd that so many people want to learn from Akira.

I know commently why the classical product is classical.
Simple scene but tell a complex story that keep logical.
And I don't remember seen from where, that product is first earn money is second.
It should be read from steve jobs biography. The good movie like a boom in my heart when I finish watch.
Like magic.

Tomorrow I and Ya will go on the journey.
Now there's a important in my mind is the oppotunity of YSJF.
It seems like I'm ready now. Maybe I need a little lucky.
To be honest, I'm not hard work today. The movie of Akira tell me I'm nothing but the world have magic!

The journey like I was choised, find myself find my road.
Hope I can live a wonderful life.
