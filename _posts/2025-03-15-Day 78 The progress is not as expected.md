# The progress is not as expected
I only have 78 days, time just leave 43% after I quit my job.
I need clean my mind, catch my main target. 

## First, What is my main target?
In this period, my main target is get the English ability.
Because I determine it will not change in 5 years.
And I can get assistant from this ability, use English to open a bigger world.

I know that many people think as seem as me.
But like marathon game, after I decide to take part in.
I have running about 40 times, day after day I fell I was changed a lot.
From running hard and weakly to have a little confidence to achieve the half marathon.

## So, talking is nothing, doing is everything.
I always want to find a good way for running faster, Waste too many time already.
Even I think that if the reason is my heart is not strong?
Why I learned too slow? Why I have too many cause for relax?

Sorry about this anxious feeling, I am trying to running fast and achieve my goal.
If I can through the time hole, will I ba able to say thanks for myself?
At least, I did say thanks to that bike guy, who to carry me to my dream.
