# Creater or business man

Well, it's a time in turning.
I go to a e-bike company and find a job.
But why I just put myself all in every time ?

The bike is good but I haven't passion again.
I don't know why, maybe I will be poor a whole life.
The boss makes much attantion on me, but I don't want to make things fail.
I found a big program or a big advance of me, it's pay more attention on other people.

Today, YSJF played a strange ball that I was invited for interview.
But I haven't got any message.
I got know this thing is for James' wechat screenshot.
I wish I can get that lucky.

Thinking about myself, I like the story I like movie, I like technology and humanity.
But why I can't use them to make meself living.
What's the reason I cycling, why I don't like the high performance bike which beside me.

I watched the video of Tim again. Well, I think he is right and always be a real man in the front or back.
I always saying that I want to join the first echelon, I want to make good product for me and other people.
Maybe I can't catch my goal forever.

Is it as Luobo said that I shouldn't catch anything because they are all boundless.
I seem like afraid fail and loss. Because I have a good grade in last stage?
I found that I have a desire for survival at the begining time that I work in X.pin.
Now I grow up more and have the chance that I couldn't have in Kunming.
I should be happer. At least I can earn for myself.

So the most important question is what kind of man I want to be.
Fllow my heart, and use those skills I learned in last planet.
Try to find the third way I can dive in.
Put myself in those positive feedbacks.
Do those things what I can do, recogize those information what I can learn.

Write this essay in English is the good method right?
Let go forword and face the rain.
Be myself, good luck.
