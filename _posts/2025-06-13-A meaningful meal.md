# A meaningful meal
It's the second friday after interview.
I have a meal with James, he told me many informations that I can use.
After many years, I finally realise that I can get help with other people.
They all happy to help me.

I have good reward for those people who helped me.
Thinking about that there are more people I want to reward.
Like my grandmother, my eldest aunt and many relatives.
They all give me some good chances to jump to the next stage.

And I did know that how important of the basic ability.
In this ages, I should increase my hard skills rather than soft skills.
Across the river for begining again.

After this talking I notice that I should hide my self when the opponent in the advance place.
Do those things better, then I will get some says.
And I and my wife quickly go to 30s.
We must consider the balance of money, health and work.

In the end, my direction is right, but my speed of walking is slow.
I have to hide my ambition.
Be a good worker than you will have some opportunities, than catch one of them is the important thing of next stage.
To become stronger man, let those people who can't say no to you.
And offer more value that you can.
It's hard to say but I still have an opportunity.
Good luck to me.
