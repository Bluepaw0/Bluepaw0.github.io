# An interview of medium level
I don’t remember when I went to join an interview.
At least I talked with the bike brand owner before.
It was practice, but it wasn’t very useful for this interview.

Although it didn’t follow my heart, I still learned many things.
I used to wear colorful glasses, but now I see that things are done by people too.
I am looking forward to another stage, but work is work.

The job needs a person who is most suitable for it.
So if I really want to change something, maybe I just need to follow myself in the end.
Now, let’s think about if the job doesn’t suit me. 
Then what can I do, and what will I become?
I'm living for the job? No!

The higher the hope, the greater the fall.
I don’t like this feeling. 
If I really fail in this place, I will stand up quickly, brush off the dust, and then go forward with more confidence.

Because people aren’t so different from each other.
Is it the choices that make the most difference?
Damn, don’t waste your true heart. Follow your heart.
Find the true value, find yourself in this journey.

Don’t always use the word “wish”.
Do something useful; maybe someday I can build my own company.
Is it that I’m just like a sword drawn from its sheath now?
"Good swords are always kept in their sheaths."
Maybe I don't understand this sentence yet.
