# An interview of medium level
I don't remember when I go to join a interview.
At least I talking with the bike owner before.
It's a practice but there's not very uesful in this interview.

Although it was not fallow my heart, but I still learned more things.
I did wear the colorful glasses before.
Things are people doing. I am looking forward to another stage, but work is work.

The job needs a man/woman who most suitable for it.
So if I really want to change sth. maybe I just fallow myself in the end.
Now, let's think about if the job don't like me.
Than what I can do, and what I will become.

As hope as high, as drop as more.
I don't like this feeling, if I really fail in this place.
I will stand up quickly and drop the dust, than go forward with more confidence.

Because people haven't so much different with each other.
Is the most different choise?
Shit, don't waste the true heart. Fellow my heart.
Find the true value, find myself in this journey.

Don't always ues this word "wish".
Do some useful thing, maybe someday I can build my own campany.
Is it that I'm just like a sword drawn from its sheath now?
"Good swords are always kept in their sheaths."
Maybe I don't understand this sentence yet.
