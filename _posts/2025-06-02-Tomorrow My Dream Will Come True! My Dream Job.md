# Tomorrow My Dream Will Come True! My Dream Job
I don’t know how to express it. I have been very excited these days. 
After quitting my job, I gave myself 180 days to achieve my goals. 
Just when I was about to give up, an opportunity found me, and I only had three days left.

I remember that on the first day I came to Hangzhou, I went to the company by bus.
Hangzhou is a big and beautiful city, but it felt a little strange to me.
I walking though these tall buildings and dream town.
I walked through the tall buildings and the dream town, thinking about how someday I would go to YSJF, which has helped me learn a lot.

Tomorrow, I finally have the opportunity to take an interview.
I think it won’t be very difficult for me now.
It’s like magic, and after 3.5 years, I can join the magic factory.

As Tim said in today’s video, direction is the most important thing.
I found that even though I wasn’t attached to my ideal goal, I still made significant progress.
And I can confidently say that I have made unlimited progress.
Oh, I haven’t passed the interview yet.
I must reflect on the past half year, which has helped me grow a lot.
Whether I win or lose, I have progressed a lot.

Finally, I hope I can reach my OKR of next 5 years.
It will solve many of my home problems.
Failure is not a bad thing; it gives me more perseverance given my circumstances.
Sometimes life is bitter, but I won’t give up.
I’m sure I will be stronger than before.

The world is hard, but it’s also beautiful and interesting.
As the old saying goes, “Keep going, and the goal will come to you.”
Good luck, see you tomorrow.
