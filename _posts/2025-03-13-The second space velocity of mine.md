# The first space velocity of mine
_Personal introduction of Bluepaw_


This is my first formal blog, I'm learning English, maybe it was arrived the basic level.
So I'm sorry to show you some sentances along with grammar mistakes.

### Where do I come from?
I'm a man comes from a small villeage in Yunnan province China.
There are no plenty of grasses and lakes at my hometown, I born from a small coal-based industrial town at east of Yunnan province.

Although there are acid rains and yellow sonw sometimes at there, but I still have a happy childhood.
Industrialization brings a lot of people in this small palce. There were about 30,000 persons work in 20km*20km land.
I often see very lively scenes and I can also paly with many children as old as me.

I finished my kindergarten and primary school at this town. Then I went to the nearest city finished highschool, finished my college at provincial capital.
After that I started join the society, work, start up and work again. Untile I touched my physical limit in a emergency project.
Fortunately, I got though it.

Then I begin to think, what is my true target?

### What is my true target?
I didn't know. I have many curiosities, I still have passion in work, I hope I can build or change something to make the future better.
Gradually, I found many things I was doing was chasing a target form others. Most of them are chasing for money. 
I like money too, but I see money like a car see oil. It's not my target, just my oil.

So I saved some oil and started the next trip after my contract finished.
I named this trip "The second space velocity of Bluepaw"
