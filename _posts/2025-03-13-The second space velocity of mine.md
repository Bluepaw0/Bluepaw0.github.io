# The second space velocity of mine

This is my first formal blog, I'm learning English, maybe it was arrived the basic level.
So I'm sorry to show you some sentances along with grammar mistakes.

### The first space velocity of mine
Let's begin, I'm a man comes from a small villeage in Yunnan province China.
There are no plenty of grasses and lakes at my hometown, I born from a small coal-based industrial town at east of Yunnan province.

Although there are acid rains and yellow sonw sometimes at my hometown, but I still have a happy childhood.
Industrialization brings a lot of people in this small palce. There were about 30,000 persons work in 20km*20km land.
My mother were married my father from a near villege, a place little higher.

I finished my kindergarten and primary school in this town, then go to the nearest city finished highschool, go to provincial capital finished my college.
After that I started to join the society, work, start up and work. Untile I touched my physical limit in a emergency project.
Fortunately, I got though it.

Then I start think, what is my true target? I didn't know, I have many curiosities, I still have passion in work, I like the life that can build or change something.
Gradually, I found many things I was doing was catch a target form others. Most of them are catch for money. 
I like money too, but I see money like a car see oil. It's not my target, just my oil.

So I saved some oil, started the next trip after my contract finished.
I named this trip "The second space velocity of little paw"
