# I don't have good emotion in our team
Let me see back, I lost trust with member of team.
And I didn't find a good method to work with my team.
As Heizemin said "A good knife is in the cave".
I seems like too harry and I don't like a mature man to solve problems.

But if you can see another direction, I still have some good outputs.
I want be a good knife, I shold know how to hide my self and work together with many good people.
In another way, I should put myself upper from the core ability--English.

English, team and production. There are never be alone, they all together.
Now I have the enviroment to make them happen to learning more.
I decide that the most important hours of days will give myself.
I plan 1 hour after my get up is to exercise, and a hour of night I should write a diary in English.
And use AI to help me to correct it in the next day.

Now I clean my mind to this essay.
First, work with team.
Second, Learn English use it every day.
Third, make a good product together.
Let's do it!
