# Back to nomal day
I have a big chance of losing the second interview.
I 'm not very integrity, which makes me don't have enough confidence.
It’s embarrassing because I was waiting for this chance for half a year.
But when I had the opportunity, I kicked it out of bounds because I used too much power.

So, what can I do during this waiting period?
I decide to try to set a plan for failure.
As Ya said, sometimes if you try to catch something too hard, you end up catching less.
Maybe someday, I will have the ability to flow with water and fly with the air.

Don’t try to be another person, but learn from everyone.
Be yourself, do those things you want to do.
Maybe today I will go to hospital to see a past coworker, who get a big injury on his feet.
I saw some pictures from the friend circle, it looks like he had surgery.
If you look back at my diary, I twisted my foot last month too.
Even today, I still feel pain when I’m walking or running.
I don’t know when I can play basketball again, but it’s good to recover.

Back to the interview, I was so nervous that I forgot to wish LaoWu a quick recovery.
It’s a little regretful. But time keeps moving forward. If I fall down, I’m sure I can stand up and keep going.
This is my biggest advantage. So if you can't join this team, don't worry too much.
You can still do some meaningful things and become a better person by yourself.
Keep going, find some chances to learn, practice, and exercise. 
Do your best and leave the rest to fate.

If I can’t join my ideal company, I still want to join this field.
The most important skill of mine is to solve problems and find focus areas.
My three focus areas are teamwork, English proficiency, and product development.
Although I don’t have sufficient experience, I can grow quickly and have the willingness to fix problems.
Fast learning and improvement are my most powerful weapons. I hope the company can see this, and I can use it happily.

In the end, the future is unknown.
I choose to climb over one mountain after another. 
Complaining is not useful; the most useful thing is to reflect on yesterday, do some right and worthwhile things today, schedule and look forward to tomorrow.
Now I know what I can do. Thank you, my daily friend.
