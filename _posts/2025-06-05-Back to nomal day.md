# Back to nomal day
I have big persent to lose the second interview.
I 'm not very integrity, it makes me haven't enough confidence.
Embarassing is I was waitting for this change for a half year.
But when I kick the ball, I kick it out of the door because I use too much power.

Then, how I can do in the waiting period?
I decide try to set a plan for failure.
As Ya said, sometimes if you catch it too hardly, you can catch less.
Maybe someday, I will have the ability to flow with water, fly with air.

Don't be the another man, but learn for everyone.
Be yourself, do those things you want to do.
Maybe today I will go to hospital to see a past co-worker, who get big injore on feet.
I saw some pictures from the friend circle, it's like he did a operation.
If you turn back to see my diary, I twickle my feet last month too.
Even today, I still have feeling of pain when I'm walking or running.
I don't know when I can play basketball, but it's good to recovery.

Back to interview, I'm so nervers don't remember to say quick to recovery to LaoWu.
It's little reget. But time will going forever if I fail down, I'm sure I can stand up and keep going.
This is my biggest advantage. So if you can't join this team, don't worry too much.
You still can do some wonderful things, and become a better person by yourself.
Keep going, find some chance to learn, practice or exercise.
Do one's best and leave the rest to God.

If I can't join my dream company, that I still want to join this industry.
The most important ability of mine is to solve problems and search directions.
My three direcctions are "Team, English and product".
Although I haven't sufficient experience, I can grow up quickly and the willness to fix problems.
Fast iteration is the most powerful weapon of me. I hope the company can see it and I can use it happily.

In the end, the future is unknow, I choose to climb across a mountain and a mountain.
Complain is not useful, the most useful thing is summarise yesterday, do some right and worthful things today, schdule and having curious tomorrow.
Now I know how I can do, thinks my daily friend.
