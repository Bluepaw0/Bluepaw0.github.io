# Tomorrow dream will come true! My dream job
I don't know how to say it.
I am in excited moment these days.
I give myself 180 days after I quit my job.
When I almost give up, the oppotunite find me. I just have 3 days then.

I remember that the first day I come to Hangzhou was went to the company by bus.
Hangzhou is a big and beautiful city, but a little strange.
I walking though these tall buildings and dream town.
Thinking about that someday I will go to YSJF which help me learn a lot.

Tomorrow I finally have the oppotunity to have a meeting test.
I think it is not very difficult for me now.
It's like a magic and I can join the magic factory after 3.5 years.

The direction is most important as the today's video of Tim said.
I found I wasn't attacted my iedal goal but I still get much advance.
And I can say unlimited progress loudly. Oh, I haven't pass the meeting test.
I must think the different half year, it makes me grow up more.
Win or loss, I go forward a lot.

Finally, I hope I can reach my OKR of next 5 years.
It will solve a lot my home problems.
Fail is not a bad thing, I have more perseverance in view of my circumstances.
Sometimes the life is bitter, but don't give up.
I'm sure I will be stronger than before.

The world is hard but it's beautiful & interesting too.
As the old words, keep going the goal will come for you.
Good luck, see you tomorrow.
