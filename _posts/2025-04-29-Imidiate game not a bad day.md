#Imidiate game & not a bad day
Let's record things flew of today.
Morning: Get up at 7am, not early but not late either.
I set an alarm at 5am but haven't done it.
As the title said, it's a imidiate day.
Like a rise of what I rebounce from the bottom.

Noon: Watched the game beteween Warriors and Rocket.
It was an excilent game. Two teams fight for the last moment, than Warroiors win.
I almost jump up in that moment.

Evening: Played the basketball again. This time I win some and be a useful man a lot.
I found I'm not very weak, and find my shooting feeling again.
Not only the feeling I get back from the game, but also I grach my confidence.
Because I trust myself I finished the last shooting and got the most important score.
As same as the work, I have more confidence now.
Trust myself and my team, we can do better than anyothers.
Now I want to record my talking practice, it's a little embrass but I can do it.
