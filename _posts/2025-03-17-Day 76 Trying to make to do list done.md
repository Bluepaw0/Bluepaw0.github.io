# Trying to make to do list done

## I have ten to do list items now
Nowadays, I used to do list to help me to move forward day by day.
I divice 3 parts as Morning, Afternoon and Evening.
Generally, I put inputs at morning and afternoon, like watch YouTube,
Use Duolingo and EF Hello app and reading English books ect.
After geting bed, I would write today's to do list, set things in a line.
Then I went out for running, return to have a breakfast and boiled a tea.
Start a new day.


## Hard to finish it everyday
But I found that I always can't make these tasks done well.
Is it too hard for me? I don't think so.
Why I can't finish it? Why I can't catch a surger?
Time is my army, I should cherish every second.
For example, I always waste much time for lunch, because of watching YouTube.

## How can I do?
Those YouTube videos also be able to help me to enhence ability.
But I can put these time to other things with higher effective. 

Second, try to fight with procrastination.
Fixed the schedule in every morning and just do it.

Finally, you should see by yourself, see clearly.
You know this period means what for you.
Transform the pressure to power, keep yourself forword.
Hope I can enhence 1% per day.
