# Totally fail
I wrote a message to HR at YSJF this morning, but now, even HR hasn’t replied to me.
I don’t know why. Maybe I have more requirements, or maybe I was too small-minded in that message?
I wrote that I have a big chance of failure, but could you give me some advice?

Now I really understand society and humanity.
I almost put myself in a hole that I can’t climb out of by myself.
I must care about others’ work but also need to care about my own needs.
I was a poor guy who just knew how to beg for something; I must learn how to hunt.

This time, I lost almost everything when I came to Hangzhou.
But I don’t want to pity myself.
I know I can do better things; I want to feed my family and have a good future.

I spoke about the future at my wedding, but now I know more that the future is built on every small step from now.
I feel that my English ability is getting better, and I’m getting more energy from my body, and becoming more mature, I think.

After this, I probably won’t have the opportunity to join this company.
I don’t know if it’s better or worse for me, but I think it’s hard.
Being a fan and hoping the company does well is enough.

The next stage is to think about how to feed myself and my family.
But I also don’t want to sell fans or do those quick-money jobs.
I really want to make a brand.
I always say it but never do it.
Do small things greatly!
Like that sentence you like to say: just make it happen!
By the way, it hurts a lot when I fall down.
