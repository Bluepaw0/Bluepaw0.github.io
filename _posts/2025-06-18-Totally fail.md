# Totally fail
I wrote a message to HR of ysjf this morning.
But now, even HR who don't reply me.
I don't know why. Maybe I have more require, maybe I have more small mind in that massage?
I wrote that I have big chance of failure but could you give me a advice?

Now I really know the society and humanity.
I almost put myself in a hole that I can't claim out by myself.
I must care others working but also need care about myself's need.
I was a poor guy who just know beg something, I must learned how to hunt.

This time I lost almost everything when I come to Hangzhou.
But I don't want to pivil myself.
I know I can do better things, I want feed my family and get a good future.

I speak something about future in my wedding.
But now I know more that the future is made on every small step from now.
I feld that my English ability is going better.
And I get more energy from my body, and get more mature I think.

After this time I should never have the oppotunity to join this company.
I don't know it's batter or worth for me.
But I think it's hard for me.
Be a fans and hope the company goes well, it's enough.

Next stage is to think how to feed myself and my family.
But I also don't want sell fans or do those quick money job.
I really want make a brand.
I always say but never to do.
Do small things grately!
Like that sentance you like to say, just make it happen!
btw, it hurt a lot when I fell down.
