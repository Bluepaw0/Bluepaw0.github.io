# The Effect of Abandoning Cats
This is the second week I'm waiting for feedback from the interview.
It's hard to say if I will have a chance to join them, not only because of my hard skills but also because of my values and opinions.

I think the reason for this situation is my willingness.
I have more thoughts about values, unlike a normal working person.
It's hard to persuade them that I'm the best one or the most comfortable person.

Maybe the second reason is that teacher YiJun doesn't like me very much.
But I don’t know how to solve this problem because I'm not too bad and I have a relationship with a worker there.
Maybe she will give me the answer by time.
Maybe she will give me the answer in time. I hope I get enough luck and courage to face the result.

Back to myself, back to the fundamental question, who am I?
I have some chances to try, and I think I am a man who wants to win.
I can give you a little story about two stores, which happened in my hometown.
The little selling store is the best result that reality has given me.
When I was young, there were two stores that opened in front of our house.
One sold good goods, the other sold bad goods.
At first, people liked to buy goods from the second store, which sold bad goods, because it was cheaper.
But when I graduated from university ten years later, the store that sold bad goods was gone, 
but the one that sold good goods had become a big supermarket on that street.

I'm an idealistic man; some ideas push me up, some ideas pull me down.
As time goes by, I wish I can find some principles that I can adhere to for my whole life.
The good things will last longer, and the bad things will be shorter. 
But no one wants to do bad things; they just want too much.

Do you believe in the law of conservation of luck?
The new media industry is moving so quickly.
In recent years, I was just a shooter and editor who learned by myself just to make a living..
I did some bad things, some strange advertisements.
Circumstances change with the passage of time.
I joined the industry like millions of people.
I was dreaming of success like those top guys.
But now I can’t even find a job.
My risk management capability is so bad, just like my father’s.

Luck is a subtle thing.
If I don’t trust my luck, I should just go home and not join the betting game.
This time, I hope I can look for the direction of my life. 
Keep going.
