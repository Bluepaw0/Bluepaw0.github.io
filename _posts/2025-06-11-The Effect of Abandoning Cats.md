# The Effect of Abandoning Cats
The second week I'm waitting for the feedback of interview.
It's hard to say I will have chance to join them.
Not only my hard ability but also my value opinion.

The reason of this situation is my willing I think.
I have more thoughts about value, not like a normal working guy.
It's hard to persuade them that I'm the best one or I'm the most comfitble person.

Maybe I meet the second cause is that teacher YiJun don't like me very much.
But who don't know how to solve this problem because I'm not too bad and have a relationship with a worker in there.
Maybe she will give me the answer by time.
I hope I get enough lucky and courage to face the result.

Back to myself, back to the bottom question, who is me?
I have some chances to try, I think I am a man who want to win.
The little selling store is the best result, which the reality give me.
When I was young, there were two stores opened in front of our house.
The one sold good goods, the other one sold bad goods.
At first people liked to buy goods in the second store which sold bad goods, because it was cheaper.
But when I graduated from university, it was ten years later.
The store which sold bad goods was gone. But which sold good goods which was become a big supermaket in that street.

I 'm a idealy man, some ideas push me up some ideas pull me down.
As the time going by, I wish I can found some principles which I can insist in my whole life.
The good things will longer and bad things will shorter.
But no one want to make bad things who just want too much.

Do you believe the law of conservation of luck.
The new media industry is going so quickly.
Near the years I just a shooter and editer who learn by my self just for living.
I did some bad things, some strange advertisements.
Circumstances change with the passage of time.
I join the industry like millions of people.
I was dreaming the success like those top people.
But now I even can't find a job.
My risk management capability is so bad, just like my father.

Lucky is a subtle thing.
If I don't trust my lucky just go home don't join the bet game.
This time, I hope I can looking for the direction of life.
Keep going.
