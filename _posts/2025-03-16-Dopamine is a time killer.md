# Day 77 Dopamin is a time killer
This artical writed at the next day. Because I have stolen a beautiful by meself.
Things begin from a game. Wild sile(The mobile phone's customer terminal of LOL, maybe it's a wrong spelling.)
I tried to play one game for relax after I made some tasks done.
But I was dove in it for 3 hours. It not only lead me haven't finish my schedule's tasks, but also sleep late a lot.
After a few moment for happy, I always delet the game with reget, but add it in someday.
I know it was a bad and funny loop, I decide fix it right now.

## My reading ability is growing
I can feel this from my daily reading. 
These days I was reading *Souce Code* by Bill Gates.
I got more details of sillicon velley from this book, also with my deeper understand.
Meanwhile I was reading *How To Read A Book* too.
Reading seems like an explore and talking with authors, can lead me find myself and give me more greater targets.

## Insist, insist and insist
After a period of running traning, I can running farster and easier.
I want to join the Fuyang half marathon on April 20.
There are about 30 days, and although I got a huge forward, I still can't run into my target now.
Finish the half marathon in 2 hours, that means I should run into 5:40 per killometers.
Now I just turch this line, I hope I can catch this goal.

So insist doing a thing is the key, to put your dream down.
I decide write Blog everyday, and use not assistant tools for garmmer or spelling.
I hope I can see how far I was going, if I return to see these words someday.

This is today, a happy day with a little beate.
Btw, I set a reward plan for how hard work.
If I did well on last day, I will get a suger that my faverite one as reward.
Many days were gone, I just got a one piece suger.
Maybe I can find the right way today?
